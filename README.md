# Send to XBMC/Kodi Firefox plugin
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/send-to-xbmc-2/

## About
Sends YouTube videos, video and music links to Kodi for playback. Adds a right click menu for links pointing to YouTube and audio/video files for direct playback on your TV with Kodi.
Works with XBMC Eden and later, as well as with Kodi Helix and newer.

This is a continuation of the original Send-to-Kodi, by Dirk-jan Mollema (dirkjanm on Github), to add support for Twitch streams and BBC iPlayer in the URL Bar.

Version 2.0 of the plugin was made open source and placed on GitHub.
This version rewrote the whole server management part of the plugin, adding support for multiple servers and adding the basics for a lot of extra features

Version 3.0 is a complete rewrite of the extension into a WebExtension, granting compatibility with Firefox 57.

## Setup XBMC/Kodi
Under System -> Services: 
 * Web Server -> Make sure it's enabled and a password is set 
 * Remote control -> Enable: "Allow remote control by programs on other systems" 
Go back to Home to save changes

Plug your Kodi info into the FireFox addon... IP can be obtained from System -> System info (Appears when System is highlighted )
